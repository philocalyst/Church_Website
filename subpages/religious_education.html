    <p>
      We are proud of the warm and caring community of religious seekers that
      we have created here at UU Church of Savannah. Our young people are free
      to explore religious thoughts and values in an environment of mutual
      kindness and respect. We offer a variety of classes and resources to
      support each child's search for truth and meaning. Our religious
      education (RE) program is headed by our Director of Religious Education,
      Megan Dunkelberg, and is supported by our enthusiastic and dedicated
      volunteers. Email Megan Dunkelberg at re@uusavannah.org with any
      questions!
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer year-round religious education (RE) for children ages 3 and up.
      Our class is currently composed of all ages in one shared classroom,
      which is located upstairs above our fellowship hall. We focus on
      learning valuable life lessons through interactive stories, meditation,
      arts and crafts, and games.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current curriculum for RE class is adapted from our Soul Matters
      material. The lessons have a new theme each month that aligns with our
      worship service theme. We would love to have you!

    <h3>Nursery</h3>
    <p>
      Our nursery is now open for children from the ages of 6 months to 4
      years. You are welcome to bring your child to the nursery prior to the
      worship service or when the children are dismissed after the Story for
      All Ages. Our nursery is located in our religious education spaces. We
      will be happy to direct you there!
    </p>
    <h3>Worship</h3>
    <p>
      Periodically – often on special holidays – our children attend a full
      worship service with the rest of the congregation. Enjoying a UU service
      gives our children a firm grounding in what it means to be a part of the
      larger congregation. It helps them prepare for the day when they are old
      enough to stay in the service every week. It also allows the adults in
      the congregation the pleasure of enjoying the enthusiasm and openness
      only children can bring to a worship experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>
      Our children’s involvement in the life of the church goes beyond Sunday
      morning. They participate in a number of social justice activities
      throughout the year, such as collecting food items for the Backpack
      Buddies program, engaging in Savannah Pride activities, marching in
      Savannah’s annual Martin Luther King Day parade, and raising money for
      the church by having a yearly book sale.

    <h3>Fun</h3>
    <p>
      Our children have fun! On periodic Fridays throughout the year we host a
      Kids' Night Out, where young people enjoy an evening of arts and crafts,
      games, and movies (and parents/guardians get to enjoy the evening on
      their own). At other times they take field trips, celebrate holidays,
      participate in music performances, and usually can be found after church
      playing in the square.

      assistants who donate their time and talents each week to our children.

      and crafts. All volunteers who regularly work with our children must
      have a background check and agree to abide by our Code of Ethics for
      Adults Working with Children and Youth.
