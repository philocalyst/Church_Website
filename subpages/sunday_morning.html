  <h3>What do Unitarian Universalists believe?</h3>
  <p>
    In Unitarian Universalism, you can bring your whole self: your full
    identity, your questioning mind, your expansive heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, we create a force more powerful than one person or one belief
    system. As Unitarian Universalists, we do not have to check our personal
    background and beliefs at the door: we join together on a journey that
    honors everywhere we’ve been before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our beliefs are diverse and inclusive. We have no shared creed. Our shared
    covenant (our seven Principles) supports “the free and responsible search
    for truth and meaning.” Though Unitarianism and Universalism were both
    liberal Christian traditions, this responsible search has led us to
    embrace diverse teachings from Eastern and Western religions and
    philosophies.
  </p>

  <h3>What time are Services?</h3>
  <p>11:00 AM year-round, and they last about one hour.</p>

  <h3>Where is the church, and what about parking?</h3>
  <p>
    311 E. Harris St, Savannah, GA on historic Troup Square (at the
    intersection of Habersham and Harris). On-street parking is free on blocks
    south of the square. Please do not park around the center of the squares -
    tickets are issued.
  </p>

  <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
  <p>Casual dress is fine. Please wear what makes you comfortable.</p>

  <h3>What about children?</h3>
  <p>
    Children are welcome as guests and as part of our Religious Education
    program. Children join the congregation for the first portion of the
    service, and then they are sung out of the sanctuary to their Religious
    Education (Sunday School) classes. After classes, the children join the
    rest of their family in the Fellowship Hall for snacks and conversation.
    The church has a nursery available for our youngest visitors. Feel free to
    contact our Director of Religious Education, Megan Dunkelberg -
    re@uusavannah.org
  </p>

  <h3>What is the Service like?</h3>
  <p>
    We gather to music, and after brief announcements and a welcome we light a
    chalice and are called to begin worship. We sing and affirm our covenant
    with each other, then collect the offering. Then we share a story for all
    ages, after which the children leave for their Religious Education
    classes. There is time to acknowledge Joys and Sorrows followed by a
    meditation and more singing. The 20-minute sermon is followed by a closing
    hymn, extinguishing of the chalice and a benediction. Most services last
    about an hour.
  </p>

  <h3>Is there music?</h3>
  <p>
    Nearly every service is enriched by our choir, led by David Neches,
    Director of Music. Occasionally there are guest musicians. We sing from
    our hymnal, Singing the Living Tradition, several times during each
    service.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I meet people?</h3>
  <p>
    You'll be greeted by folks who've volunteered to introduce you to the
    church and help you get yourself and your children oriented. There's an
    opportunity to introduce yourself, if you wish, during the service.
    Afterward, please feel welcome to connect during our social hour in the
    Fellowship Hall. You can always reach out to admin@uusavannah.org to
    connect in more specific ways.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I learn more about the church and membership?</h3>
  <p>
    Starting Point events offer a thorough introduction to Unitarian
    Universalism and this church. These classes are offered regularly. Of
    course, feel free to ask anyone you meet for more information.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I get involved in the life of the church?</h3>
  <p>
    There are a number of groups working in the church where you can connect
    with others, help keep the church healthy, and put your skills to work for
    the greater good of the community. If you don't see what you're looking
    for on this website, or in Social Hour, please reach out to
    admin@uusavannah.org.
