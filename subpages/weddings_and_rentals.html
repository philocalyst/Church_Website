		The Unitarian Universalist Church of Savannah is proud to offer our
		beautifully restored sanctuary as the perfect setting for your wedding or
		commitment ceremony. The entrance to our sanctuary faces one of Savannahâ€™s
		picturesque historic squares, which is filled with gorgeous oak trees
		draped with Spanish moss, and surrounded by elegant period homes. We
		believe that providing non-members the opportunity to be married within
		our church is an important part of our community ministry. We welcome the
		use of our space by couples of all genders and sexual orientations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our sanctuary is climate-controlled and comfortable in all seasons. The
		sanctuary can seat up to 175 people in eight rows of pews with a center
		aisle. The wonderful acoustics and professional sound system of the
		sanctuary will enhance any music in your ceremony. There is a balcony
		available for use by photographers, videographers, and musicians. The
		ceremony is usually conducted in the raised apse to allow for convenient
		viewing by all guests.
	</p>

	<p>
		You are welcome to use our minister, or to bring your own officiant. At
		least one consultation with our minister is required if you would like her
		to conduct your ceremony. All weddings and ceremonies include the services
		of our onsite Wedding Coordinator, as well as the services of an audio
		technician for a fee.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are three additional spaces available for rent in our buildings.
		Please peruse the photos at the bottom of this page. Rahn Hall is our
		recently renovated social space that includes a full kitchen, and can
		accommodate up to 50 guests. Additionally, we have our downstairs Green
		Room which has a mini-fridge and two couches. Upstairs there is another
		lounge space that features a fireplace and lots of natural light
		overlooking Harris Street. There are no stairs leading into Rahn Hall, and
		there is a ramp to access the sanctuary on Macon St.
