        <p>
          Welcome to the website of the Unitarian Universalist Church of
          Savannah. Our members and friends, and the wider Savannah community,
          know this institution to be many things
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>The Jingle Bells Church</strong>, because composer James L.
        Pierpont was one time music director of the church;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A welcoming congregation</strong>, because we welcome and
        celebrate the presence and participation of bisexual, gay, lesbian,
        transgender and straight people;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A community</strong> dedicated working to build a diverse
        multicultural and beloved community by taking actions that dismantle
        racism and other oppressions;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The host of</strong> Savannah’s annual MLK, Jr. Day concert;
      </p>
      <p><strong>The producer of</strong> the Music Alliance Concert Series;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>The only Unitarian Universalist church</strong> in the United
        States to operate a radio station; and
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our faith home</strong>, wherein we worship weekly, celebrate
        holidays and holy days, mark life passages with rituals, attend to the
        faith development of children, youth and adults, and hold one another in
        fierce and tender care.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will learn more about all these facets of our church as you explore
        this website. Our Facebook page is also a good source of current
        information about events and happenings. And I, and all the staff
        members, board members, and volunteers whose names and contact
        information you’ll find on this site, are eager to have a conversation
        with you about your faith journey and answer questions you may have
        about Unitarian Universalism and the Unitarian Universalist Church of
        Savannah. The surest way, however, of determining whether or not this
        might be the church you’ve been looking for, is to join us for worship
        or meditation or a concert or justice project. We’ll welcome you in your
        sacred fullness, whoever you are, and consider ourselves blessed by your
        presence–one time or for a lifetime. We hope to see you soon.

      <h3>The Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalism</h3>
      <p>
        We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association,
        covenant to affirm and promote:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The inherent worth and dignity of every person</li>
        <li>Justice, equity and compassion in human relations</li>
        <li>
          Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our
          congregations
        </li>
        <li>A free and responsible search for truth and meaning</li>
        <li>
          The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within
          our congregations and in society at large
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a
          part
        </li>
        <li>
          Journeying toward spiritual wholeness by working to build a diverse

          dismantle racism and other oppressions in ourselves and our
